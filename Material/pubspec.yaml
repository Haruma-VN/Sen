        # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
        # assets:
        #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
        #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

        # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
        # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

        # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
        # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

        # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
        # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
        # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
        # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
        # example:
        # fonts:
        #   - family: Schyler
        #     fonts:
        #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
        #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
        #         style: italic
        #   - family: Trajan Pro
        #     fonts:
        #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
        #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
