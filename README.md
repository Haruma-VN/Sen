## Final Words

-   The purpose of this project just one, simplify many tasks. I highly believe that only by contributing open source project can people achieve the fully productivity and creativity. In the other hand, monopolizing technology for the good of a small group of people, is meaningless as there will be people willing to share them in the future. If anyone has walkthrough the time we using outdated tools for processing files, we know how to treasure what we have today.
