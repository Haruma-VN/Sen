# About

-   `Sen` is a cross platform project that will helps you create your own PvZ2-Mods.

-   This project was based on the project [Tre](https://github.com/Haruma-VN/Tre), both of them are made by me but `Tre` is no longer maintaining because of platform issues. `Sen` is basically the cross platform version of `Tre` and provides safer functions.

## Modulus Composite

-   `Shell` - Using `.NET 8.0 Runtime` as Console Application Project, create interface and has various functions inside it.

-   `Internal` - Using `CMAKE` for cross-platform and C++ Standards to provide additional function to the `Shell`.

## Final Words

-   The purpose of this project just one, reduce the barrier between low-level modders and profession modders. I highly believe that only by contributing open source project can people achieve the fully productivity and creativity. In the other hand, monopolizing technology for the good of a small group of people, is meaningless as there will be people willing to share them in the future. If anyone has walkthrough the time we using `QuickBMS` or `Mali Textool Compression` for editing game files, we know how to treasure what we have today.
